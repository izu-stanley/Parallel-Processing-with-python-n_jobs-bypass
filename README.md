# Parallel-Processing-with-python-n_jobs-bypass
This notebook shows how you can force all your CPU cores to come alive. 
Most modules in python run on only 1 core of your comuter so if you have a multicore CPU, a significant portion of your processing power is sitting idle and your code would not be running as fast it should.

This notebook shows how it can be implemented by using the process pool executor class.

Notebook code is explained inside it.
